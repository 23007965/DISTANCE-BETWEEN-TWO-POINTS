# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Giving values to the point x1 and x2
### Step 2: 
Giving values to the point y1 and y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple
### Step 5: 
At last,print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
```

x1,x2=10,4
y1,y2=6,2
d=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
c=round(d,2)
print(c)
```

### OUTPUT:
